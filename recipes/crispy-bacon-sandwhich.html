    <img src="../images/baconswhich.jpg" alt="Delicious!">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The perfect meal for a lazy Sunday morning, or for an upset tummy.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul class="ingredients">
        <li>Four full size rashers of thin cut bacon</li>
        <li>Lurpak butter</li>
        <li>Thick cut white bread</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol class="method">
        <li>Melt a generous tablespoon of butter on high heat. Wait until it is fully melted (but well before it browns).<br><br></li>
            <ul>
                <li>(You may want to put your tub of butter back into the fridge at this point - it is important it is not half melted by the time you butter your sandwhich!). <br><br> </li>
            </ul>
        <li>Begin adding the bacon rashers. If the pan is smaller, you may not have room for all four, so you can stagger them.<br><br></li>
        <li>Heat until fat is sizzling at the top of each rasher and it has shrunk by a third to a half (~ 2-3 mins).<br><br></li>
        <li>Flip the bacon and heat for another ~2 mins until the rashers have shrunk by another third or so.<br><br></li>
        <li>Flip a final time and ensure both sides have the classic "caramelised" brown edges and ridges before turning off the heat.<br><br></li>
        <li>Place the rashers onto some kitchen roll to get rid of the excess fat, and meanwhile butter your bread generously.<br><br></li>
        <li>Add the bacon to the sandwhich, and voila, you have the perfect crispy bacon sandwhich!<br><br></li>
    </ol>
